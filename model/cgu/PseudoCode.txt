We trust DXSI to do dependency management, packaging correctly
therefore the parent 'package' for all DXSI dependent libraries will be
"model.cgu.dxsi"
 -- commons-beanutils.pom
 -- commons-beanutils.jar
 -- $parent-version

Use the model.cgu.dxsi parent version as the control (Snapshot?)

RISK: Duplicate or conflicting usage of an open source library in projects
MITIGATION 1: Maintain Maven records? (Effort?, Upkeep?) < 20 dependencies, how often changing?
MITIGATION 2: Maintain Master list, strict approval process for Open Source library usage in team
